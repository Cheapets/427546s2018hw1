During this weeks of lecture, Professor Haim mentioned that the functions to get the shapes appear on a canvas are online. He didn't want us to spend a ludicrous amount of time and effort to make each of the individual shapes (Rectangle, Ellispe, Circle, and Line) appear. As stated within the submission form we needed to state that we did in fact get online assistence to accomplish what we could for the assignment.
